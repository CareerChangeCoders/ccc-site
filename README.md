# Career Change Coders landing page

## Download and Installation

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/careerchangecoders/ccc-site.git`

## Usage

After installation, run `yarn` to install the projects dependencies and then run `gulp` in order to build the assets.

Once every thing has been installed and built, you can then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp dev` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made
- `gulp css` compiles SCSS files into CSS and minifies the compiled CSS
- `gulp js` minifies the themes JS file
- `gulp vendor` copies dependencies from node_modules to the vendor directory

You must have Yarn and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
